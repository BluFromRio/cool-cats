                Intersectionality is a framework for understanding how different social identities—such as race, gender, and class—
                interact to create unique experiences of discrimination and privilege. Coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, the concept 
                challenges the idea that discrimination can be examined in isolated categories.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the tech industry, intersectionality is often ignored in diversity initiatives, which focus heavily on gender 
                without considering how race or class affects inclusion. For example, many efforts to promote women in tech 
                primarily benefit white women while leaving out the unique challenges faced by Black and Indigenous women.

                Implicit biases are subconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions. 
                In the workplace, these biases shape hiring practices, promotions, and workplace culture; often reinforcing systemic 
                inequalities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Research has shown that hiring algorithms, designed to remove human bias, often reflect the prejudices of their creators. 
                A 2018 study found that AI hiring tools discriminated against women and people of color, reinforcing existing hiring biases 
                rather than eliminating them. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/insight-amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK0AG/" target="_blank">Article Link</a>.

            <p>
                The transition of semiconductor production from Navajo women to outsourced labor in South Asia is just one example of 
                how marginalized communities are exploited in the tech industry. This follows a broader pattern where labor is taken 
                from communities with less structural power while corporate benefits remain concentrated at the top.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another overlooked aspect is the role of eugenics in shaping hiring practices. Figures like William Shockley openly 
                supported racist theories that have influenced the way companies justify exclusionary hiring. This historical precedent 
                contributes to modern systemic barriers in the workplace.

                    <p>
                        "Intersectionality highlights the invisible labor that powers the tech industry but is rarely acknowledged. 
                        Studying the history of semiconductor manufacturing made me realize how entire groups—like the Navajo women who 
                        helped build the industry—have been erased from tech’s narrative. Recognizing intersectionality means 
                        acknowledging these power structures instead of reducing diversity to a surface-level checkbox."

                    <p>
                        "For me, intersectionality is about visibility and lived experience. As a woman of color in tech, I’ve seen how 
                        diversity efforts often prioritize white women while ignoring racial barriers that Black and Brown women still 
                        face. The idea that gender equality can be tackled first and racial equality ‘will come later’ is flawed—
                        these struggles are not separate."

                    <p>
                        "Intersectionality is about understanding how power and privilege shape opportunities. Certain groups are funneled 
                        into leadership roles while others are pushed toward low-wage labor. The ‘model minority’ myth, for example, has 
                        placed unrealistic expectations on Asian workers in tech, benefiting corporations while reinforcing racial 
                        hierarchies. If we want real change, we have to challenge these structures, not just acknowledge them."
